# football_stats_bot

So hey there, the purpose of this was to create a bot which would provide the users with the statistics of a Manchester United Player over the course of a season.
How it would work, is if the redditor invokes the bot by typing a comment 
  "statsbot!"<player_name>
This would immediately search for the player name in a datframe which compromises of stats which has been extracted from the fbref page. Furthermore, from a slew of metrics, we select the most effective stats for a player.


#Future Updates

* Moving from File based system to save replied comments to a database which stores the replied to comment id.
* Expanding player database to involve players not only from the Premier League, but also the top european clubs.
